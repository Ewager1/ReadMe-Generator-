## Installation

- This program requires Node.js to be installed on their computer. Open the command line in this folder and type 'npm install inquirer' and 'npm install fs' so your computer knows which modules to reference. To execute this program, type node index.js.

## Usage

- By answering questions in the project, a readme will be automatically generated in this same folder.

- Note that all headings will appear in the readme, even if the user leaves an answer blank. The user can still go it an edit the file after it has been made to delete those headings or further modify the document.

- Note: If there is a readme already generated, then running this program will erase and replace that readme. It is recommended the user moves the readme into their project folder once they are happy with it to avoid this user error.
